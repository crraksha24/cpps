1.how to find logical errors in c progarmming?
 compare with the existing  program-strategy to learn program
-mental tracing(understanding of concepts maybe incorrect)
-add printf statements wherever possible-to find the control flow.
-print the values of the variables.
2. Why do we use the if statement?
   If statement is used to test a condition, if condition is true then the code inside the if statement is
   executed otherwise that code is not executed.
3.why should if-else statement be used?

5.what is the purpose of return statement?
  terminates the execution of a function.
6.int main()
{
 int x,y,z;
 input(&x,&y);
 z=compare(x,y);
 output(x,y,z);
 return 0;
}
error: too many arguments to function ‘output’
  output(x,y,z);
 The number of arguments in the main function for the output and the main should be the same.
 Rectification :
int main()
{
 int x,y,z;
 input(&x,&y);
 z=compare(x,y);
 output(z);
 return 0;
}
